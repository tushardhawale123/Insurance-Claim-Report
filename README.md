- **Technologies:** Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL), BI tools (Power BI/Excel), open data.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Scripts for handling duplicates, missing values, and data standardization.
- **Summary & Analytics:** Pre-built queries for:
  - Total claims and total policies
  - Average exposure and Bonus/Malus
  - Claims breakdown by region, area, vehicle brand, fuel type, and driver age group
- **BI-ready Outputs:** The SQL results are ready for direct use in Power BI, Excel, or other visualization tools.
- **Custom Visual Theme:** Includes a custom wallpaper/theme for report visuals.
- **Exported Reports:** Sample exported PDF output is attached for portfolio/demo use.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft SQL Server (or compatible T-SQL environment)
- Access to [openml dataset 41214](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=41214&status=active)
- (Optional) Power BI or Excel for creating visuals

### Setup Steps

1. **Set Up the Database**
   - Run `schema.sql` in your SQL Server to create the necessary database and tables.

2. **Import Data**
   - Download the CSV from OpenML.
   - Import the data into the `InsuranceClaims` table using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or a bulk import tool.

3. **Clean & Prepare Data**
   - Execute `etl.sql` to remove duplicates, handle NULLs, and standardize fields.

4. **Run Analyses**
   - Use the queries in `analysis.sql` for generating insights and summary statistics.

5. **Reusable Components**
   - Optional: Run `views_procedures.sql` to create views and stored procedures.

6. **Visualize**
   - Use your BI tool of choice to visualize the results.
   - Apply the included `report_wallpaper.png` for a professional look.
   - Reference the sample `InsuranceClaimReport.pdf` for expected output.

## üîé Example Queries

- **Total Claims per Region:**
  ```sql
  SELECT Region, SUM(ClaimNb) AS TotalClaims
  FROM InsuranceClaims
  GROUP BY Region
  ORDER BY TotalClaims DESC;
  ```
- **Average Claims by Vehicle Brand:**
  ```sql
  SELECT VehBrand, AVG(ClaimNb) AS AvgClaims
  FROM InsuranceClaims
  GROUP BY VehBrand
  ORDER BY AvgClaims DESC;
  ```

For more, see the `analysis.sql` file.
